== Description ==
Six Color Schemes sourced from the official United States Web Design Standards and NASA brand guides.

The United States Web Design Standards were developed by 18F and the United States Digital Service.

While these admin schemes strive to maintain the US Web Design Standard's 508 compliancy (highly visually-accessible), due to hover states and default Admin styles they aren't 100 percent compliant.

== Installation ==
1. Install via WordPress Admin or download .ZIP and upload manually.
2. Activate the Plugin
3. Color Schemes are selected on a per-user basis. Select a scheme by going to Your Profile and selecting a swatch of colors.

== Changelog ==
1.0 - Initial release
